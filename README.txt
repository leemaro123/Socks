12:45 I have started assignment upon Socks.

	  I have created a web app which name is Socks.

	  I created Socks.cs page.

	  I included seven properties over there.

12:59 I thought I'm missing something, and I found that
	  it was readme file. 

	  I created it.

1:17 I have created database context MvcSocksContext.cs file.

	 I executed provided content in that file.

2:26 I get back to work.

	 Updated Startup.cs file by Using statements
	 and add provided code to Startup.ConfigureServices.

	 Also updated json file by adding connencting string.

2:31 First I used scaffold tool in order to create 
	 CRUD pages for the socks modle.

	 Then used the EF Core Migrations feature to create the database.

2:40 I wrote everything on readme file.

	 and started testing.

	 It was working perfectly.

3:15 I created SeedData.cs Class
	 into Models folder.....

	 I insert 10 records of Socks with diferent properties.

	 They, I updated Program.cs file in order to make SeedData
	 working..... :)

3:20 I finally tried to run program...

	 Ooops! There was something wrong with Program.cs file.

3:40 I found the error.

	 I forgot to include one using stetement, now I have
	 added it....

3:50 Now I have noted everithing in Readme file.

4:15 I have updated socks.cs file with controller mathods
	 and view by provided code.

4:30 Now I reached at search menu.

	 That's why I have updated index method three times 
	 in socksController.cs file.

4:45 I started adding search socks by type.

	 I built class SocksTypeViewModel.cs in Modles folder.

	 I execuit code by provied ppt.

4:55 Replace the Index method 
	 in MoviesController.cs with provided code.

	 I forgot to update Index.cshtml file and 
	 I directly tried to run the code.

	 Then I find out it won't work
	 without that file.

5:15 Update Index.cshtml found in Views/Movies/ as
	 given code.
	 h
	 Then I was curious to see my output.
	 Bingo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

	 It worked.......... :)
	 and it says when your code works,
	 don't touch it.

9:00 After having dinner, I was feeling so good,
	 I didn't think that assignment gonna that much faster now.
