12:45 I have started assignment upon Socks.
	  I have created a web app which name is Socks.
	  I created Socks.cs page.
	  I included seven properties over there.

12:59 I thought I'm missing something, and I found that
	  it was readme file. 
	  I created it.
	  Then I upload this whole thing with github,
	  and I commited and pushed it there
	  on 1:04.

1:17 I have created database context MvcSocksContext.cs file.
	 I executed provided content in that file.

2:26 I get back to work.
	 Updated Startup.cs file by Using statements
	 and add provided code to Startup.ConfigureServices.
	 Also updated json file by adding connencting string.

2:28 Then I updated readme file,
	 and commite all stuff on github.
