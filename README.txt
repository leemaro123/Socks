12:45 I have started assignment upon Socks.
	  I have created a web app which name is Socks.
	  I created Socks.cs page.
	  I included seven properties over there.

12:59 I thought I'm missing something, and I found that
	  it was readme file. 
	  I created it.
	  Then I upload this whole thing with github,
	  and I commited and pushed it there
	  on 1:04.

1:17 I have created database context MvcSocksContext.cs file.
	 I executed provided content in that file.

2:26 I get back to work.
	 Updated Startup.cs file by Using statements
	 and add provided code to Startup.ConfigureServices.
	 Also updated json file by adding connencting string.

2:28 Then I updated readme file,
	 and commite all stuff on github.

2:31 First I used scaffold tool in order to create 
	 CRUD pages for the socks modle.
	 Then used the EF Core Migrations feature to create the database.

2:40 I wrote everything on readme file.
	 and started testing.
	 It was working perfectly.

3:15 I created SeedData.cs Class
	 into Models folder.....
	 I insert 10 records of Socks with diferent properties.
	 They, I updated Program.cs file in order to make SeedData
	 working..... :)

3:20 I finally tried to run program...
	 Ooops! There was something wrong with Program.cs file.

3:40 I found the error. 
	 I forgot to include one using stetement, now I have
	 added it....
	 and booooommmm....
	 My code is working...

3:50 Now I have noted everithing in Readme file.
	 And commite code to github.

4:15 I have updated socks.cs file with controller mathods
	 and view by provided code.
	 Then I commited code to github.
